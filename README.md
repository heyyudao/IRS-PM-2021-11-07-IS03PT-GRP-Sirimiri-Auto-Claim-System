## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT

Sirimiri Private Limited is a newly established international Food & Beverages Services company based in Singapore. The company aims to bring the best quality food across the globe to Singaporeans. The company's employees are constantly travelling to different countries to source the best quality food products. Hence, many expenses are spent overseas, be it taxis, food expenses, hotel accommodations etc. As Sirimiri Private Limited's business expanded, the company's claiming process had become a hassle to the management team. Therefore, the CEO of Sirimiri Private Limited has decided to look into Artificial Intelligence and automation to see if there is an intelligent solution for this. 

Sirimiri Private Limited have approached Yudao and Engkoon. They are students of NUS ISS undertaking the Graduate Certificate in Intelligent Reasoning Systems to develop an intelligent application to help the company automate their claiming process. Sirimiri Private Limited is looking for a fast rule-based automation setup built on a readily available platform, so its employees can claim their expenses anywhere around the globe. 

The solution proposed by Yudao and Engkoon is a chatbot built on the most popular instant message platform, i.e., Whatsapp. First, the chatbot can retrieve employee information through conversation using Dialogflow, a natural language understanding platform. Then, validate the claim amount using built-in OCR capabilities. Finally, the chatbot will auto-approve or reject a claim based on a user-defined rule-based system created using jBPM, an open-source workflow engine written in Java that can execute business processes. All the setups are then deployed on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud to allow the employee to claim their expenses anytime in the day.
